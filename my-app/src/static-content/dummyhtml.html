    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
    at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
    obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
    going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
    of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
    treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
    Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
    amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
    the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
    humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
    believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you
    need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
    middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend
    to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
    generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
    words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
    generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem
    Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
    non-characteristic words etc.

    <span>Why do we use it?</span>
    <hr />
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

    <span>Denouncement</span>

    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
